This project is based on the video tutorial "Learn the mern stack" from Traversy Media

I am using this to improve my skills in MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and NodeJS, it should
in no shape or form be used in a production environment in it's current state.

If there are any bugs, tips or tricks you want to share with me, do not hesitate to create an 
issue on Github
